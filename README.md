#Deeplearning Neural Network for the Processing PDE.

A Neural Network class with deeplearning capabilities
 to test performance of different types of cells for the Processing PDE.

### cells:
Simple-Cell: standard FFNN Cell with SoftSign activation

Memory-Cell: Cell with weights for previous Inputs

MixGateCell: Cell that "mixes" current input and past OutputState
